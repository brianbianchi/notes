## Depth First Search

1. Create a recursive function that takes the index of node and a visited array.
2. Mark the current node as visited and print the node.
3. Traverse all the adjacent and unmarked nodes and call the recursive function with index of adjacent node.

## Breadth First Search
Starting at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph), and explore all of the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

## Hash Tables
Data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions are typically accommodated in some way.
